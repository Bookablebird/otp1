# Logistorage is a database management tool, created by Paavo Helin(me), Valtteri Hemill√§ and Joonas Lehikoinen.
This project was for courses "Ohjelmisto projekti 1 ja 2"(software project 1 and 2) at Metropolia, University of applied sciences.

There are some documentation in Finnish, but the code and comments are in English.

#*Notice* 
This project was done as a group, and I can not take full credit for it. 
I did most of the design work and a big part of the general code, but the db part of the code I didn't really touch.
